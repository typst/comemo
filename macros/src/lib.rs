/// Memoize a function.
///
/// This attribute can be applied to free-standing functions as well as methods
/// in inherent and trait impls.
///
/// # Kinds of arguments
/// Memoized functions can take three different kinds of arguments:
///
/// - _Hashed:_ This is the default. These arguments are hashed into a
///   high-quality 128-bit hash, which is used as a cache key.
///
/// - _Immutably tracked:_ The argument is of the form `Tracked<T>`. These
///   arguments enjoy fine-grained access tracking. This allows cache hits to
///   occur even if the value of `T` is different than previously as long as the
///   difference isn't observed.
///
/// - _Mutably tracked:_  The argument is of the form `TrackedMut<T>`. Through
///   this type, you can safely mutate an argument from within a memoized
///   function. If there is a cache hit, comemo will replay all mutations.
///   Mutable tracked methods can also have return values that are tracked just
///   like immutable methods.
///
/// # Restrictions
/// The following restrictions apply to memoized functions:
///
/// - For the memoization to be correct, the [`Hash`](std::hash::Hash)
///   implementations of your arguments **must feed all the information they
///   expose to the hasher**. Otherwise, memoized results might get reused
///   invalidly.
///
/// - The **only obversable impurity memoized functions may exhibit are
///   mutations through `TrackedMut<T>` arguments.** Comemo stops you from using
///   basic mutable arguments, but it cannot determine all sources of impurity,
///   so this is your responsibility.
///
/// Furthermore, memoized functions cannot use destructuring patterns in their
/// arguments.
/// 
/// # Local memoization
/// 
/// In the case where you would want to explicitely restrict usage to a single
/// thread, you can use the [`#[memoize(local)]`](macro@memoize) attribute.
/// This will use thread-local storage for the cache and requires a call to the
/// [`local_evict`](comemo::local_evict) function to clear the cache.
/// 
/// Additionally, if you wish to pass borrowed arguments to a memoized function
/// you will need to manually annotate it with the `'local` lifetime. This allows
/// the macro to specify the lifetime of the tracked value correctly.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// /// Evaluate a `.calc` script.
/// #[comemo::memoize]
/// fn evaluate(script: &str, files: comemo::Tracked<Files>) -> i32 {
///     script
///         .split('+')
///         .map(str::trim)
///         .map(|part| match part.strip_prefix("eval ") {
///             Some(path) => evaluate(&files.read(path), files),
///             None => part.parse::<i32>().unwrap(),
///         })
///         .sum()
/// }
/// 
/// // Evaluate a `.calc` script in a thread-local cache.
/// // /!\ Notice the `'local` lifetime annotation.
/// #[comemo::memoize(local)]
/// fn evaluate(script: &'local str, files: &comemo::Tracked<'local, Files>) -> i32 {
///     script
///         .split('+')
///         .map(str::trim)
///         .map(|part| match part.strip_prefix("eval ") {
///             Some(path) => evaluate(&files.read(path), files),
///             None => part.parse::<i32>().unwrap(),
///         })

/// Make a type trackable.
///
/// This attribute can be applied to an inherent implementation block or trait
/// definition. It implements the `Track` trait for the type or trait object.
///
/// # Tracking immutably and mutably
/// This allows you to
///
/// - call `track()` on that type, producing a `Tracked<T>` container. Used as
///   an argument to a memoized function, these containers enjoy fine-grained
///   access tracking instead of blunt hashing.
///
/// - call `track_mut()` on that type, producing a `TrackedMut<T>`. For mutable
///   arguments, tracking is the only option, so that comemo can replay the side
///   effects when there is a cache hit.
///
/// If you attempt to track any mutable methods, your type must implement
/// [`Clone`] so that comemo can roll back attempted mutations which did not
/// result in a cache hit.
///
/// # Restrictions
/// Tracked impl blocks or traits may not be generic and may only contain
/// methods. Just like with memoized functions, certain restrictions apply to
/// tracked methods:
///
/// - The **only obversable impurity tracked methods may exhibit are mutations
///   through `&mut self`.** Comemo stops you from using basic mutable arguments
///   and return values, but it cannot determine all sources of impurity, so
///   this is your responsibility. Tracked methods also must not return mutable
///   references or other types which allow untracked mutation. You _are_
///   allowed to use interior mutability if it is not observable (even in
///   immutable methods, as long as they stay idempotent).
///
/// - The return values of tracked methods must implement
///   [`Hash`](std::hash::Hash) and **must feed all the information they expose
///   to the hasher**. Otherwise, memoized results might get reused invalidly.
///
/// Furthermore:
/// - Tracked methods cannot be generic.
/// - They cannot be `unsafe`, `async` or `const`.
/// - They must take an `&self` or `&mut self` parameter.
/// - Their arguments must implement [`ToOwned`](std::borrow::ToOwned).
/// - Their return values must implement [`Hash`](std::hash::Hash).
/// - They cannot use destructuring patterns in their arguments.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// /// File storage.
/// struct Files(HashMap<PathBuf, String>);
///
/// #[comemo::track]
/// impl Files {
///     /// Load a file from storage.
///     fn read(&self, path: &str) -> String {
///         self.0.get(Path::new(path)).cloned().unwrap_or_default()
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl Files {
///     /// Write a file to storage.
///     fn write(&mut self, path: &str, text: &str) {
///         self.0.insert(path.into(), text.into());
///     }
